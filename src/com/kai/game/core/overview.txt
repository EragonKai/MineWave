New changelog file as of December 2018!

Was writing this when IntelliJ crashed and deleted it...

MineWave was fun.
I'd like to go back and add new features/clean it up.
I've decided to almost completely rewrite it, only using some snippets here and there.
I'll be able to add more systems and basically fun things.

Old changelog (from over a year ago) was stored in 'A. Changelog.txt' (OldMineWave/src/com/kai/A. Changelog.txt).
All new notes and changes will be put here.

All TODOs/planned changes can be found using IntelliJ's to-do finder thing.

    1/13/19:
        - Added MagicBall
        - The last thing causing ConcurrentModificationExceptions comes from the draw functions, no idea what it is
        - Added GunSkill
        - Set up "passive" system for skills
        - Added a really bad way of enabling "hold to shoot" for GunSkill
        - Removed the ton of ugly constants for width/height


Still need to add deathscreen, leaderboards

Possible way to have effects:
    have effect (implements updatable) class that takes in an entity, duration, and effect type
    and has methods to modify the values but saves og values
    then have a list of current effects in entity that is cycled through and updated
    and then as updated the effect counts down cooldown and then resets to og values
    boom im a genius thanks god
    !wesley

Future Enemy Possibilities:
    - A thrower who throws a damaging aoe attack.
    - A 'castle' that spawns armored insects and shoots you.
    - An enemy that teleports.
    - An enemy that heals surrounding/nearby enemies.
    - Something with both ranged and melee, switching between the two modes with distance.
    - Buzzsaws/lasers/Something to restrict movement.

Future:
    - Items
    - Traits
    - Stats
    - More things to chose from when creating your character
    - Similarly to Ambush, go through rooms and have a map
    - More Bosses
