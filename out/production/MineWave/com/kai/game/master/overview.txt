New changelog file as of December 2018!

Was writing this when IntelliJ crashed and deleted it...

MineWave was fun.
I'd like to go back and add new features/clean it up.
I've decided to almost completely rewrite it, only using some snippets here and there.
I'll be able to add more systems and basically fun things.

Old changelog (from over a year ago) was stored in 'A. Changelog.txt' (OldMineWave/src/com/kai/A. Changelog.txt).
All new notes and changes will be put here.

All TODOs/planned changes can be found using IntelliJ's to-do finder thing.
