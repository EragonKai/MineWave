## MineWave
A horrendous mess of code that hurts to look at. Stay far, far away, for your own sake.

You play as a rectangular-ish guy who can place up to 7 mines at once. Choose an ability and stay alive for as long as you can, with a (local) leaderboard!

Update: As of 12/25/18, I am returning to reconstruct this idea and rebuild it to be more flexible. 

This is an outdated module. *Return to the top level /src/ for the newer project.*
