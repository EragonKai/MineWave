Was writing this when Intellij crashed and deleted it...

Basically, out of all the programs I've created since MineWave, nothing has been more enjoyable to play.
I'd like to go back and add new features/clean it up.
I've decided to almost completely rewrite it, only using some snippets here and there.
I'll be able to add more systems and basically fun things.

Old changelog was stored in 'A. Changelog.txt'.
All new notes and changes will be put here.
